Hi, my name is Anthony Song. I once had a dream to become a professional hockey player. Chasing my dream, I went to 3 different high schools, lived in 4 different states, and met some of the most unbelievable friends and characters. Now as I enter into the field of research, I strive to integrate the social, teamwork and leadership skills that propelled my hockey career, into my work as a biomedical engineering PhD student. My hope is to one day make a contribution in the world of medical imaging and diagnostics. Outside of the lab, I am still involved in the hockey community as a head coach, leader of a sled hockey program, and an avid men's leaguer (everyone ends up here haha). 

I love hearing about different journeys, so if you ever want to share your story or just chat with me, my door is always open. Have a blessed day, cheers!
